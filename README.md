Space Engineers Logic Sequencer mod
===================================

This is a mod to Space Engineers that adds a Logic Sequencer block into the game.

A midpoint between the Timer and the Programmable block, designed mainly to
perform short lists of actions based on a set of triggers and conditions.

The design of the logic sequences is heavily inspired by Home Assistant, albeit
with some limitations due to how Space Engineers works in regards to modding.

**NB**; Still heavily WIP, expect it to not work at all.

Issues and PRs are welcome [at GitHub](https://github.com/ananace/SE-LogicSequencer)
